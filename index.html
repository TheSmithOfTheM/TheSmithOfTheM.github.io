<h1>The Hilarity of the Hamilton Musical</h1>

<p><em>Hamilton: An American Musical</em>, although being based
    around actual historical figures, has some of the funniest
    screenshots and moments from the Disney Plus movie. Here
    are some of them that I find amusing:</p>

There's many papers scattered about. Basically... it's all chaos.">
